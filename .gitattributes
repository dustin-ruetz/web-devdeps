# The repo's "Languages" percentages on the https://github.com/dustin-ruetz/web-devdeps
# repo homepage misidentifies some TypeScript files as JavaScript due to the fact that
# their first line is the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang comment. Fix this
# by manually specifying the language for just these particular files.
